# Automation, Productivity, and Employment Trends in the United States

## Overview
Advances in automation and artificial intelligence have raised widespread concerns about job displacement and long-term employment stability. This project explores the relationship between automation-driven productivity growth and employment trends in the United States to assess whether increased productivity correlates with job loss or workforce shifts over time.

Using publicly available economic data, this analysis investigates how productivity gains align with employment patterns across multiple decades.

---

## Research Question
Does increased automation and productivity growth correspond to decreases in employment, or do employment levels remain resilient despite technological advancement?

---

## Data Sources
The analysis uses publicly available U.S. economic datasets, including:
- Productivity indices
- Employment and labor force statistics
- Time-series economic indicators from government databases such as FRED and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)

The datasets span multiple decades, allowing for long-term trend comparison.

## Methods
This project applies exploratory and descriptive data analysis techniques, including:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Time-series visualization
- Trend comparison between productivity and employment metrics
- Correlation-based analysis to identify relationships between variables

All analysis was conducted in Google Colab notebooks.

---

## Key Findings
- Productivity has steadily increased over time, reflecting ongoing technological advancement.
- Employment levels do not show a proportional long-term decline alongside productivity growth.
- The results suggest that while automation changes the nature of work, it does not necessarily eliminate jobs at a macroeconomic level.
- Short-term disruptions may occur, but long-term employment trends appear more complex than simple job replacement.

## Why This Matters
Understanding the relationship between automation and employment is critical for:
- Workforce planning and policy development
- Economic forecasting
- Ethical deployment of AI and automation technologies
- Preparing future engineers and data scientists to design technology that complements human labor

This analysis contributes to a data-driven perspective on a highly debated topic.

## Contribution
I was responsible for exploratory analysis, visualization, and interpretation of results, as well as synthesizing findings into a written narrative.

---

## Limitations & Future Work
- The analysis is correlational and does not establish causation.
- Industry-specific employment trends & self-employment (which is on the rise in upcoming generations) were not separately analyzed.
- Future work could include sector-level analysis, predictive modeling, or international comparisons.
